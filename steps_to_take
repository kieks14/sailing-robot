To rewrite the provided ROS launch script in Python, you'll need to replicate the functionality of each ROS node and parameter loading within your Python script. Here's a series of steps to help you achieve this:

1. **Python Script Structure**: Create a Python script that will serve as your launcher. You can start with a simple Python script and gradually expand it as you replicate the functionality of each ROS node.

2. **Parameter Loading**: Load the parameters from the YAML files using Python libraries. You can use the `yaml` module to load these parameters into Python dictionaries. For example:

   ```python
   import yaml

   with open('default.yaml', 'r') as file:
       default_params = yaml.safe_load(file)

   # Load other parameter files similarly
   ```

3. **Replicate Nodes**: Create Python classes or functions to replicate the functionality of each ROS node. You'll need to implement the main logic of each node, including any message publishers or subscribers. For example:

   ```python
   class TasksNode:
       def __init__(self):
           # Initialize any necessary variables

       def run(self):
           # Implement the main logic of the 'tasks' node
           pass
   ```

4. **Launching Nodes**: In your launcher script, create instances of these Python classes or call the functions to simulate launching the nodes. For example:

   ```python
   tasks_node = TasksNode()
   tasks_node.run()
   ```

5. **Logging and Output**: Replace ROS-specific log statements with Python's built-in logging module or print statements for debugging and output. For example:

   ```python
   import logging

   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   logger.info("This is a log message.")
   ```

6. **Namespace Handling**: If your ROS nodes use namespaces, make sure to replicate the namespace functionality in your Python script by properly organizing variables and parameters.

7. **Testing**: Test your Python script thoroughly to ensure that it replicates the behavior of the ROS nodes accurately. You can use Python's unittest framework or other testing libraries for this purpose.

8. **Iterate and Expand**: Continue this process for each node in your ROS launch script, replicating the functionality until your Python script simulates the entire ROS environment.

9. **Run the Python Script**: To run your Python script, simply execute it with Python:

   ```bash
   python your_launcher_script.py
   ```

10. **Debugging**: As you work on replicating the functionality of each node, use Python debugging tools like `pdb` to troubleshoot issues and ensure that your Python script behaves as expected.

By following these steps, you can gradually rewrite your ROS launch script into a Python script that imitates the behavior of the ROS nodes. Be prepared to spend time testing and debugging to ensure that your Python script accurately replicates the ROS functionality. Additionally, you may need to implement message handling if your nodes publish and subscribe to topics, simulating message passing as needed in your Python script.
